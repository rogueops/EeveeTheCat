<h2>About Eevee</h2>
        <p>Eevee was a blacked-out version of the "Grumpy Cat" with a heart full of love and a personality bigger than her tiny frame. Adopted at the age of 6 after a tough start in life, she quickly became the little queen of her new home. She loved sunbathing, gourmet treats, and ruling her kingdom with an iron paw. Eevee lived to be 16 years old and left behind a legacy of love, sass, and unforgettable memories.</p>

Eevee pasted away while laying in one of her favorite spots in font of a window and fell asleep like she always does....

When adopted she without the owner knowing was on a list to be put down the following day so this connection was purely a chance that happened. No regrets...

RIP Eevee
