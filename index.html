        <h2>About Eevee</h2>
        <p>Eevee was a blacked-out version of the "Grumpy Cat" with a heart full of love and a personality bigger than her tiny frame. Adopted at the age of 6 after a tough start in life, she quickly became the little queen of her new home. She loved sunbathing, gourmet treats, and ruling her kingdom with an iron paw. Eevee lived to be 16 years old and left behind a legacy of love, sass, and unforgettable memories.</p>
