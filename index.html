        <h2>About Eevee 🌟</h2>
        <p>Eevee was a blacked-out version of the "Grumpy Cat" with a heart full of love and a personality bigger than her tiny frame. Adopted at the age of 6 after a tough start in life, she quickly became the little queen of her new home. She loved sunbathing 🌞, gourmet treats 🍣, and ruling her kingdom with an iron paw. Eevee lived to be 16 years old and left behind a legacy of love, sass, and unforgettable memories. 💖</p>
